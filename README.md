# wp-flat-theme

### Legacy Theme boilerplate

STABLE BETA {under testing - work in progress}<br>
A custom easy theme from stratch

**Near to first release! Check back in a few days.**

This is a candidate release... Please wait.

-   Cassic Wp posts
-   Woocommerce shop
-   Multilang
-   Bootstrapped
-   Detailed Customizer
-   Ready to modding

Obviously, if you need a shop, you will need to install woocommerce. Once this is done, here is a collection of very useful resources, such as plugins and all the presets to be imported into the theme in this [file on megaupload](https://mega.nz/file/T6xVHDQR#A4YXsMIiZZ3tXa12ePLYKtoYUFZx8iz931P4cfZS0FM)

### Resources

Currently inside zip:<br><br>
01 - wp-flat-theme.rar _a version of theme. We strongly raccomended download from this repository, generally it isn't updated. In any case install the theme on first_<br><br>
02 - plugins.zip (more importers/exporters, lang system, other...)<br>
03 - uploads image (all demos).zip<br>
04 - Products demo.csv<br>
05 - WIDGETS (use text).wie<br>
06 - MEDIA CATEGORIES [eng] .xml<br>
07 - PAGES (multilang).xml<br>
07 - PAGES [ita].xml<br>
08 - SITE MENU  [multilang] (use plugin not wp import!).json<br>
08 - SITE MENU [eng] (use plugin not wp import!).json<br>
09 - DEMO POSTS [eng] .xml<br>
10 - ADMIN MENU EDIT.dat<br>
<br>

The order is not a fantasy, it's the import steps. Expecially if you use the multilang system (currently based on [sublanguages](https://it.wordpress.org/plugins/sublanguage/) or you will encounter several bugs.
